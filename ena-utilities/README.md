Utilities by others
-------------------

- A [Python package that lets you interrogate the ENA using the BIGSI web portal](http://54.194.218.233/philipwfowler/2018/08/31/new-software-pygsi/) to interrogate the bacterial and viral pathogen genetic data in the ENA/SRA as of late 2017.

Zam Iqbal and his group have developed an index for all the bacterial and viral pathogen genetic data in the ENA/SRA as of late 2017 which is searchable. It is called BIGSI and you can try it here (the resemblance to an early Google is not, I suspect, a coincidence) and you can find the preprint here.
