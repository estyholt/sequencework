Taxon Lookup Scripts
===================

- LookUpTaxon.py   

>LookUpTaxon.py takes as input a file of sequences in FASTA format from NCBI and gives a report of the taxons involved. It laso makes an output file with each taxon added to the description line of each FASTA record.

- LookUpTaxonComd.py   

>LookUpTaxonComd.py takes as input a file of sequences in a modified FASTA format where my BioalignerNamer script has added the common name of the organisms and gives a report of the taxons involved. It also makes an output file with each taxon added to the description line of each FASTA record.
