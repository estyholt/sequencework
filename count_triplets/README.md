triplet_frequency.py 
===================


Takes a set of RNA sequences and analyzes the frequency (actually the nunber of total counts) of triplet nucleotide occurences among the entire set.
Developed to aid an undergraduate in  designing oligonucleotides for a nano-RNA project.

There is a web-based version that does this without command line [here](http://fomightez.pythonanywhere.com/triplet_freq/).
