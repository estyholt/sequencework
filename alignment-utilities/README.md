# Alignment utilities

Repo for my own computational resources dealing with aligning and alignments (both nucleic and protein), plus give me a place to reference other handy resources.


Utilities by others

I have several listed [here](http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/User:Wayne_Decatur/Sequence_analysis_tools) such as those that interconvert/reformat alignments in various forms. Just search `align` on that page to step through examining them.
