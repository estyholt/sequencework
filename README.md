sequencework
============

Mainly python scripts related to nucleic or protein sequence work

I sorely need to put an index here with links to better guide to the appropriate folders. **TO DO** (For now look at the title of the folders to try and discern if it is something of interest.)

Descriptions of the scripts are found within `README.md` files in the sub folders.
