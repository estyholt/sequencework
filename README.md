============

Mainly python scripts related to nucleic or protein sequence work

I sorely need to put an index here with links to better guide to the appropriate folders. <== **TO DO**  
(For now look at the title of the folders to try and discern if it is something of interest.)

Descriptions of the scripts are found within `README.md` files in the sub folders.

[My simulated data repo](https://github.com/fomightez/simulated_data) has some useful scripts and resources for generating simulated (mock / fake) gene expression data or gene lists.
