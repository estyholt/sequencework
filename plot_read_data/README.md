Scripts for plotting data associated with reads from high-throughput sequencing
==============================================================================

placeholder for where I'll put:

  - `plot_coverage.py`

  - `plot_coverage_and_starts.py`

Note for the two I intend to put here first they need data previously generated by the use of [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) with sorted and indexed BAM files for sequencing data.
Another Note for the two I intend to put here first --> Despite the names, they both have `--export_data` options that can be called to easily pass the data they mine from the input data, but *** WHEN THIS OPTION IS USED NO PLOT IS MADE ***. It is meant to be used in conjunction with plots probably already made and with other scripts, see the section `Related items created by myself` below.

Related items created by myself
-------------------------------

I have made a script that will utilize the `--export_data` option to run `plot_coverage_and_starts.py` to automate an effort:
* [`shepherds_read_starts_at_start_of_origins_thru_to_plotting.py`](https://github.com/fomightez/mini-pipelines)

Specifically, the script [`shepherds_read_starts_at_start_of_origins_thru_to_plotting.py`](https://github.com/fomightez/mini-pipelines) will utilize the `--export_data` option to run `plot_coverage_and_starts.py` in an automated manner and plot the starts in a subregion of the data using the script `plot_stacked_bar_plots_with_fit.py`. `plot_stacked_bar_plots_with_fit.py` is found [here](PUT URL HERE) as it is general and not specific to read data.
