Scripts for processing and visualizing data associated with reads from high-throughput sequencing
===============================================================================================

placeholder for where I'll put:

  - `plot_coverage.py`

  - `plot_coverage_and_starts.py`

**Note for the two I intend to put here-->** These need data previously generated by the use of [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) with sorted and indexed BAM files for sequencing data.  
**Another Note for the two I intend to put here first -->** Despite the names, they both have `--export_data` options that can be called to easily pass the data they mine from the input data, but **WHEN THIS OPTION IS USED NO PLOT IS MADE**. It is meant to be used in conjunction with plots probably already made and with other scripts, see the section `Related items created by myself` below.

I have made a script that utilizes the `--export_data` option to run `plot_coverage_and_starts.py` to automate an effort:
* [`shepherds_read_starts_at_start_of_origins_thru_to_plotting.py`](https://github.com/fomightez/mini-pipelines)

Specifically, the script [`shepherds_read_starts_at_start_of_origins_thru_to_plotting.py`](https://github.com/fomightez/mini-pipelines) utilizes the `--export_data` option to run `plot_coverage_and_starts.py` in an automated manner and plot the starts in a subregion of the data using the script `plot_stacked_bar_plots_with_fit.py`. The associated script `plot_stacked_bar_plots_with_fit.py` is found [here](https://github.com/fomightez/general_scripted_plotting), as it is general and not specific to read data.

Not for high-throughput data, but for a different type of modern sequencing data:
